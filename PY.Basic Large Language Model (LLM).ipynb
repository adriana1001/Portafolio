    "# Basic Large Language Model (LLM) concepts and their application\n",
    "\n",
    "To build an application with LLMs, we need to become familiar with several basic concepts first. We will start with text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading PDF documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the texts we wish to analize will be stored in a text format. Ideally, this format will be `.txt`. Nevertheless, this is seldom the case, as it is much more common for texts to be stored in PDF format. Luckily, there exist tools specifically built for these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must take into account, however, that although these tools are designed for loading and processing documents in PDF format, this file type has some intrinsic limitations that make this end more difficult. The most relevant limitations for our goals are image processing, and parsing mathematical expressions and tables. Images are ignored by PDF text loaders, and tables and mathematical expressions are parsed into raw text. There are some new approaches being developed to correct these issues, like processing PDFs through AI. These approaches are currently not as flexible and compatible with other tools, and are outside of the scope of this session. For now, we will use the simplest approach and take its limitations into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a working example, we will use the article [\"Learning from Shared News: When Abundant Information Leads to Belief Polarization\" by Bowen, Dimitriev and Galperti (2022)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28465/w28465.pdf). We will be using the `pypdf` package. We start by downloading the article with `requests` and saving it in the present work directory. As a technical side note, Colab functions through a container that allows us to access a Linux file system; our default work directory is `/content`"

      "Recent decades have witnessed rising polarization in politics, media, and public opinions—\n",
      "especially in the US. In their review about this phenomenon, Fiorina and Abrams (2008)\n",
      "stress the importance of focusing on polarization in opinions. Pew Research Center (2014)\n",
      "notes that those at both the left and right ends of the political spectrum have a greater im-\n",
      "pact on the democratic process than those with mixed views—by being the most likely to\n",
      "vote, donate to campaigns, and participate directly in politics. Alesina et al. (2020) ﬁnd\n",
      "that “Americans are polarized not only in their views on policy issues and attitudes towards\n",
      "government and society, but also about their perceptions of the same, factual reality.” So-\n",
      "cial divisions, in general, have been linked to negative economic and political outcomes, such\n",
      "as inequality, political gridlock, weak property rights, low investment or growth. As a con-\n",
      "sequence, economists have devoted signiﬁcant attention to its causes.1\n",
      "The causes of belief polarization may seem obvious at ﬁrst glance, but reality presents\n",
      "several puzzles. Some have blamed misinformation or fake news. However, this explanation\n",
      "is at odds with recent evidence that people are reasonably good at detecting real from fake\n",
      "news (Angelucci and Prat (2021)). Others have blamed the ease of access to distorted\n",
      "information through the Internet.2However, the Internet has also brought an abundance of\n",
      "information, which should lead people to learn quickly and beliefs to converge (not diverge)\n",
      "according to standard economic models. The evidence on the eﬀects of the Internet is\n",
      "also mixed: Some papers ﬁnd that social media increases polarization (e.g., Allcott et al.\n",
      "(2020)), others ﬁnd more polarization oﬀ line than on (e.g., Boxell et al. (2018); Zhuravskaya\n",
      "et al. (2020)).3Finally, some have blamed consumption of news from biased echo chambers.\n",
      "This explanation is also incomplete: If people get some (even small) amounts of unbiased\n",
      "informative news—which is often the case (Pew Research Center (2014))—they should still\n",
      "learn the truth according to standard economic models.\n",
      "To shed light on these issues and clarify possible drivers of belief polarization, this paper\n",
      "oﬀers a theoretical framework that focuses on how people learn from shared news. We ask if\n",
      "polarization can result merely from how people consume and share information through social\n",
      "connections, whether online or oﬄine. If so, will technology-driven abundance and sharing\n",
      "of information reduce or increase polarization? Our answers rely on a simple, yet ﬂexible,\n",
      "model that incorporates two key empirical ﬁndings. First, people often share information\n",

      "2selectively (for instance, by remaining silent when it is unfavorable), which causes their\n",
      "listeners to consume unbalanced diets of second-hand news. Second, people tend to neglect\n",
      "selection in their second-hand information and, thus, misperceive its content. Misperception\n",
      "is akin to reading too little into the absence of news from friends, or more intuitively, reading\n",
      "too little into their silence.4We ﬁnd that this misperception and the quality of information\n",
      "play critical roles in causing some people to learn incorrectly while others learn correctly.\n",
      "This causes their beliefs to polarize. Our theory requires neither preexisting diﬀerences in\n",
      "people’s worldviews nor misinformation. We can explain why changes in people’s information\n",
      "ecosystem triggered by the Internet may aﬀect polarization.\n",
      "In our model agents learn about a binary state of the world, AorB. In every period,\n",
      "each agent receives ﬁrst-hand information—an objective i.i.d. signal about the state—with\n",
      "probability γ, and no signal otherwise. We refer to the signal’s informativeness—i.e., how\n",
      "likely it is to match the true state—as its quality. In every period, each agent can stay silent\n",
      "or share her signal with her social connections, called friends . We capture selective sharing\n",
      "by assuming that some agents, called dogmatic, share only signals supporting one state; the\n",
      "other agents, called normal , share every signal. For example, a dogmatic agent may be\n",
      "someone who holds a particularly strong view on whether to vaccinate children and share\n",
      "only articles in favor of that view; normal agents share any article on the topic. We refer to\n",
      "an agent’s sources of second-hand signals as her echo chamber, because these constitute the\n",
      "group of people she is connected to for the purpose of news sharing. As suggested by the\n",
      "empirical literature, we capture selection neglect by assuming that agents have a misspeciﬁed\n",
      "mental model of the signal process. That is, each agent believes that each of her friends gets\n",
      "a signal with probability ˆγ<γ. Observationally, this is consistent with the agent excessively\n",
      "attributing her friends’ silence to absence of news rather than suppression of news. Except\n",
      "for this misspeciﬁcation, our agents update beliefs using standard Bayes’ rule.\n",
      "Our ﬁrst contribution is to characterize how agents learn in this environment. Consis-\n",
      "tent with the prevailing narrative, we ﬁnd that echo chambers can lead people to learn in-\n",
      "correctly, but this result comes with important qualiﬁcations—conceptually and practically.\n",
      "Conceptually, selective sharing by itself cannot lead to incorrect learning, let alone polariza-\n",
      "tion. This is because if an agent fully understands how her friends select what to share, she\n",
      "will adjust for it and her beliefs will not be systematically distorted. People’s misperception\n",
      "of selection in their news is necessary for echo chambers to distort beliefs. But this is still\n",
      "not enough. Moreover, we show that information quality also needs to be suﬃciently low for\n",
      "distortions to occur, which has practical implications as we explain in the paper.\n",
      "To be more speciﬁc, we analyze learning in the short and long run, i.e., after one round\n",
      "of signals (scarce information) and after inﬁnitely many rounds (abundant information).\n",
      "4For evidence of selective sharing, see Shin and Thorson (2017); Weeks et al. (2017); Shin et al. (2018);\n",

      "so-called “below-average eﬀect” in psychology (Erev et al. (1994); Kruger (1999)). Online\n",
      "Appendix C.1 shows how our results change if ˆγ>γ. In a nutshell, now the agent updates\n",

      "as bad news for the state that friend prefers. As a result, while for ˆγ<γthe distorting\n",
      "power of echo chambers pushes the agent’s belief in the direction of the state preferred by\n",

      "The case of ˆγ<γseems more consistent with both the evidence on selection neglect in\n",
      "Section 3 and the common understanding of the eﬀects of echo chambers on beliefs.\n",
      "Next, we consider misspeciﬁcations that do not involve the rate of news arrival. That is,\n",
      "assume that all agents correctly assign probability γto the arrival of ﬁrst-hand information\n",
      "in each period (i.e., ˆγ=γ). Instead, we analyze misspeciﬁcations of the following variables:\n",

      "rationale for fact-checking as a way to realign ˆqwith q.\n",
      "7.2 Applicability to News Media Outlets and Social Media\n",
      "The previous discussion of other misspeciﬁcations allows us to clarify how our insights relate\n",
      "to settings such as news media outlets and social-media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.\n",
      "First, our analysis applies unchanged if we interpret a friend as a news media outlet. In this\n",
      "case, normal friends correspond to outlets that report news objectively; dogmatic friends\n",
      "29instead correspond to outlets that report news selectively with some slant, which can be\n",
      "modeled as in (I).\n",
      "Second, unlike peer-to-peer news sharing that occurs oﬀ line at family gatherings, work,\n",
      "or parties, online sharing on social media is often mediated by algorithms (for example, on\n",
      "Facebook). These algorithms select what we see in our news feed, possibly using diﬀerent\n",
      "probabilities depending on the kind of news as in (I). As such, they play a similar role of\n",
      "our dogmatic agents. Moreover, news-feed algorithms tend to be very complex and lack\n",
      "transparency. It is then likely that most people may have misspeciﬁed models about how\n",
      "these algorithms work as in (I), possibly adding to the causes of selection neglect discussed\n",
      "in Section 3. In this case, news-feed algorithms can also trigger our main mechanism of\n",
      "incorrect learning and lead to polarization.\n",
      "Finally, our theory can also apply in settings like Twitter, where there are a small number\n",
      "of “serial tweeters” and a mass of followers. In this context, examples of our dogmatic agents\n",
      "are plentiful, and information suppression on an issue can take the form of tweeting about\n",
      "other issues. Followers may misperceive the tweet selection of their followee, either by under-\n",
      "estimating his news arrival rate as in the baseline model, or in one of the forms discussed\n",
      "above ((I), (II), or (III)).\n",
      "7.3 Selective News Sharing and Endogeneity\n",
      "The selective sharing of our dogmatic agents can be interpreted in at least two ways. The\n",
      "ﬁrst is that dogmatic agents care about the state (i.e., it aﬀects their underlying preferences),\n",
      "but have extreme beliefs that are very hard to change—perhaps because they are stubborn,\n",
      "narrow minded, or blindly follow and promote their conviction. Formally, they have a de-\n",
      "generate prior belief that places probability 1 on either AorB, which does not change with\n",
      "new information. Alternatively, dogmatic agents can change their views, yet much more\n",
      "slowly than non-dogmatic agents.21As a result, how they selectively share information is\n",
      "very persistent. A second interpretation is that dogmatic agents do not care about the state\n",
      "(their underlying preferences are state independent) and simply share information to pro-\n",
      "mote their agenda. This is related to the framework in Jin et al.’s (2021) experiment—and,\n",
      "of course, more general models of selective sharing of veriﬁable information starting in the\n",
      "80s. In that experiment, “senders” face the same sharing decisions as in our model: disclose\n",
      "the signal they have or stay silent, but nothing else. They also have monotonic preferences\n",
      "in receivers’ belief about the state, while receivers want to learn correctly.\n",
      "Future research may endogenize selective sharing in settings similar to ours. In Online\n",
      "Appendix D, we take a ﬁrst step in this direction by exploring an extension in which the\n",
      "type of selective sharing we assume in the paper emerges endogenously. This extension uses\n",
      "several standard assumptions to keep things simple. Generalizing these assumptions points\n",
      "to future work.\n",
      "21For studies on people’s reluctance to change worldview see, e.g., Edwards (1968), Nisbett and Ross\n",
      "(1980), Evans (1989), Nickerson (1998), and Galperti (2019).\n",
      "307.4 News Re-Sharing\n",
      "In reality, people can re-share news received from friends, and thus any agent may receive\n",
      "third-, fourth-, or nth-hand information. Our model assumed no signal re-sharing, but we\n",
      "can easily extend our analysis to allow this. For instance, Jane may receive a signal shared by\n",
      "Tom through a friend of hers. The simplest case is when Jane knows the paths that a signal\n",
      "travelled to reach her. This is similar to knowing the origin of a re-tweet on Twitter. In this\n",
      "case, re-sharing is equivalent to adding Tom as a direct friend in Jane’s echo chamber. If\n",
      "the paths allow all signals to reach Jane, it is equivalent to adding Tom as a friend of Tom’s\n",
      "type; if the paths allow only signals favorable to state ωto reach Jane, it is equivalent to\n",
      "adding Tom as an ω-dogmatic friend.\n",
      "As it is well known from the literature on rational learning in networks (see, e.g., Mueller-\n",
      "Frank (2013), Golub and Sadler (2016), Mueller-Frank and Neri (2021)), complications can\n",
      "arise if Jane does not know the origin of a signal or the paths it travelled. Since our signals\n",
      "are veriﬁable, if there is no more than one path, there is no confounding or correlation issue.\n",
      "But if there are multiple paths, two re-shared signals may come from the same origin, which\n",
      "introduces correlation. In this case, however, consistent evidence shows that people tend to\n",
      "neglect correlation (Enke and Zimmermann (2019)), which has been previously assumed in\n",
      "social-learning models (Eyster and Rabin (2010b))). Under this assumption, each path from\n",
      "a source to Jane acts as a separate friend in her echo chamber. As long as correlation is\n",
      "suﬃciently weak, one can show that it does not matter for long-run beliefs.\n",
      "Finally, we can capture re-sharing in a reduced form as increasing the news-arrival rate for\n",
      "an agent’s friends (i.e., γ). This is because they can now share both a signal they got directly\n",
      "from its source (e.g., a newspaper) and a signal they got from one of their friends. The\n",
      "consequences can be easily seen through our results. If re-sharing increases γbut agents do\n",
      "not take this into account fully, it eﬀectively becomes another mechanism that leads to ˆγ<γ.\n",
      "7.5 Agents’ Heterogeneity\n",
      "A ﬁnal comment is in order on the heterogeneity between normal agents that we allow. We\n",
      "assumed that only the composition of echo chambers can diﬀer between them. Otherwise,\n",
      "they are identical and have the same model of the world: The prior π, the signal distribution\n",
      "(γand (1)), and the form of information misperception ( ˆγ, (I), (II), or (III)) are the same for\n",
      "all. This setting helps to focus on the role of diﬀerent information diets due to echo cham-\n",
      "bers as a driver of belief polarization. It is intuitive that adding diﬀerences between agents\n",
      "can introduce other drivers of polarization, which can be easily inferred from our results.\n",
      "8 Concluding Remarks\n",
      "We studied if and when learning from shared news can lead to belief polarization. Our\n",
      "answer is consistent with some common narratives about news sharing, yet highlights several\n",
      "qualiﬁcations. Selective sharing alone cannot lead to polarization, even if it gives rise to\n",
      "31unbalanced news diets. It has to be combined with some misperception that causes people to\n",
      "incorrectly respond to others’ selection of news, which has been documented in the literature\n",
      "on selection neglect. Moreover, this key mechanism leads to polarization if (and only if) the\n",
      "quality of ﬁrst-hand information is suﬃciently low. These results clarify the relationship\n",
      "between information quality, selective sharing, and polarization.\n",
      "Our analysis goes to the heart of why new communication channels and formats on the\n",
      "Internet may contribute to or curb polarization. First, the dramatic expansion of commu-\n",
      "nication between people may have increased the consumption of selected second-hand news\n",
      "(e.g., on social media). Second, the quality of consumed information may have worsened:\n",
      "Tweets and social-media posts tend to be short, imprecise, and absorbed only superﬁcially.\n",
      "Third, the Internet has oﬀered bad actors a megaphone to spread fake news, and we found\n",
      "that it is selective sharing—not fake news per se—that can distort beliefs. Bad actors may\n",
      "also try to expand echo-chamber imbalances or, more subtly, release bits of true but low-\n",
      "quality news with high frequency (like Tweets), which ampliﬁes the power of misperceived\n",
      "selective sharing. However, the Internet may also help people access higher-quality news and\n",

      "We study learning via shared news. Each period agents receive the same quantity and quality of \n",
      "first-hand information and can share it with friends. Some friends (possibly few) share \n",
      "selectively, generating  heterogeneous news diets across agents akin to echo chambers. Agents are \n",
      "aware of selective sharing and update beliefs by Bayes' rule. Contrary to standard learning results, \n",
      "we show that beliefs can diverge  in this environment leading to polarization. This requires that (i) \n",
      "agents hold misperceptions (even minor) about friends' sharing and (ii) information quality is \n",
      "sufficiently low. Polarization can worsen when agents' social connections expand. When the \n",
      "quantity of first-hand information becomes large,  agents can hold opposite extreme beliefs \n",
      "resulting in severe polarization. We find that news aggregators  can curb polarization caused by \n",
      "news sharing. Our results hold without media bias or fake news, so eliminating these is not \n",
      "sufficient to reduce polarization. When fake news is included, it can lead to polarization but only \n",

This might seem like a very subjective measure (and, fundamentally, it truly is), but we can quantify it thanks to Natural Language Processing and some math. First, we must generate embeddings; these are vectors that encode the semantic content of each text. Both our chunks and the user's query can be encoded this way; because each vector represents $n$ dimensions of semantic content, we would expect that if the  content in a chunk is relevant it will be close to the content of the question.

Second, the quality of consumed information may have worsened:\\nTweets and social-media posts tend to be short, imprecise, and absorbed only superﬁcially.\\nThird, the Internet has oﬀered bad actors a megaphone to spread fake news, and we found',\n",

However, our results qualify this narrative: Polarization requires\\nlowqand misperception of the eﬀects of echo chambers (recall Remark 1), but does not\\nrequire fake news nor that people look at the world through fundamentally incompatible\\nparadigms. It does not even require that echo chambers be unbalanced in opposite direc-\\ntions: By Propositions 3 and 4, if dAi≥dBifor all i∈N anddAj−dBj>dAk−dBkfor\\nsome j,k∈N, then there always exists q>1\\n2such that Π(e)>0if the true state is ω=B.\\nFor suchN, ifqis intermediate, some agents will be eventually correct despite their echo\\nchamber, while others will be eventually incorrect.\\nThese observations highlight the importance of information quality for echo chambers to\\ngive rise to belief polarization. Intuition may suggest that as people receive better informa-\\ntion, disagreement should decline. In fact, the following result provides conditions for po-',\n",

Our results then suggest\\nthat fake news can cause incorrect learning and polarization, but only indirectly through\\nselective news sharing .

In this\\ncase, normal friends correspond to outlets that report news objectively; dogmatic friends\\n29instead correspond to outlets that report news selectively with some slant, which can be\\nmodeled as in (I).\\nSecond, unlike peer-to-peer news sharing that occurs oﬀ line at family gatherings, work,',\n",
       "  '5.1 Mitigating Polarization\\nFerejohn et al. (2020) note that challenges to shaping the character of democratic institutions\\ninclude “managing the development of media and information technologies to ensure they\\nenhance, rather than degrade, robust pluralism and civil political engagement.” This section\\ntakes a step in that direction.\\nHow could a social planner address polarization caused by shared news? Selective sharing,\\nmisperceptions, and echo chambers of friends seem diﬃcult to inﬂuence. It may be more\\nstraightforward to inﬂuence the quality of their ﬁrst-hand information. For instance, this\\nmay involve incentivizing newspapers to spend more on reporters, data gathering, and fact\\nchecking. But this direct way may be infeasible for technological or economic reasons. This\\nsection suggests a feasible way to increase the quality of information that people ultimately\\nreceive without changing qof the original sources.\\nThe last decades have witnessed the rise of news aggregators , online platforms that sum-\\nmarize news for their users (e.g., The Drudge Report, Apple News, Yahoo!
